This code is written by Dr. Qi-Te Yang.

GCS_PSO_RF, GCS_PSO_KNN, GCS_PSO_CSVC, and GCS_PSO_NBC are four GCS-PSO variants with different classification models.
To run these algorithms, please put this folder in the directory of '...\PlatEMO\Algorithms\Multi-objective optimization\' of the PlatEMO platform and run 'platemo.m'.
